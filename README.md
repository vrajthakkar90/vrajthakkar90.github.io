## About Me

I am a **highly motivated individual** currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Technology in Mathematics and Computing** at **DA-IICT**. My primary interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision** and **geometry processing**. I enjoy working on complex problems that blend computational algorithms with real-world visual data.

I have a keen interest in **geometric deep learning**, **3D data processing**, and developing efficient algorithms for **mesh manipulation** and **shape analysis**.

## Projects

- **Laplace-Beltrami Operator Solver**  
  A Python-based project that implements the Laplace-Beltrami operator on 3D meshes to study their properties using ODE solvers.
  
- **Voronoi Area Calculation in Meshes**  
  A tool for efficiently calculating Voronoi areas of 3D meshes using cotangent weights and mesh properties.

## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB
- **Libraries & Tools**: libigl, trimesh, OpenCV, TensorFlow
- **Areas of Expertise**: Mesh Processing, Computational Geometry, Computer Vision, Machine Learning
