## About Me

I am a **highly motivated individual** currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Technology in Mathematics and Computing** at **DA-IICT**. My primary interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision** and **geometry processing**. I enjoy working on complex problems that blend computational algorithms with real-world visual data.

I have a keen interest in **geometric deep learning**, **3D data processing**, and developing efficient algorithms for **mesh manipulation** and **shape analysis**.

## Projects

- **As-Rigid-As-Possible**

  A Python-based project that implements the ARAP algorithm on 3D meshes for deformation
  
- **Laplacian Mesh Editting**

  A python based implementation of the Laplacian mesh editing scheme for intuitive deformation.

- **Rigidity Informed Mesh deformation algorithm**
  
  A python based implementation of the rigidity informed mesh deformation algorithm.

- **Shape analysis and Statistics**
  
  For the course Computational Shape modelling, in a group of two we did labs implementing algorithms for shape analysis, deformation like skinning, shape statistics etc.

- **Deep learning architectures**

  Self learning labs for learning different architectures and techniques in deep learning like node dropeout, Encoder-Decoder, U-net, Resnet etc. and experimentation on biologically plausible algorithms for replacing backpropogation.

- **Differential geometry of curves and surfaces**

  Did an independent project on differential geometry of curves and surfaces with Prof. Aditya Tatu

- **Approximation Algorithms**

  In a group, for the course project we explored the approximation algorithms used in networks.

- **Time series**

  For the course project we explored ARIMA models and other statistical tools used in time series on the temperature data in india.
